This is a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br/>
I have used WebSocket to make the game real time.<br/>
I have used Spring Boot on backend html, css and js in frontend.<br/>
Currently, the application is not persistent as I have not used any database.</br>
I would love it if someone adds database(relational db).
